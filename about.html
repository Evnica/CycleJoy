            All along the tour you will stop in the best places of Vienna. If you reach a sight the app will give you
            a description about the sight. You can decide if you visit the Museum or just discover the sight and
            neighborhood from the outside. Once you have explored this place you have to answer a question, which is only
            available once you've reached read the description and are close to the point. Is the answer right you will
            get the coordinates to your new location and the route to the next sight is calculated. On the way
            you also have the possibility to activate the editor mode and create your own points of interest or edit already
            existing points to show other users places you like.</p>

        <p>
            IMPORTANT: If you do no permit access to your current location all sights of the chosen trip are shown in the map and
            the route will not be calculated. You can do the trip without taking part in the quiz challenge!
