            Do you want to cycle in Vienna and learn more about the city? Then this app is for you! We offer you 3
            thematic trips: nightlife journey, kids trip and a cultural challenge. Choose the one you like in the header
            on this page and get redirected to the map. You will see your first target. Navigate to it, read its
            description, answer a quiz question and find out, where you go next! Be careful: if you give a wrong answer
            twice, your next location might not be the closest one, and your trip may take longer than stated in the
            description. But don't worry! Even in this case you can still reach the final destination. Good luck!
        </p><br>
        <p class="txt">
            IMPORTANT: If you do no permit access to your current location all sights of the chosen trip are shown
            in the map and the route will not be calculated. You can still do the trip, but without taking part in
            the quiz challenge.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            NOTE: The app is in the demo mode now. This means that you can participate in the quiz without being
            located anywhere near the current destination. Once the test phase is over, the app quiz will be only
            accessible if you are located within 250m from the current target. Also, the geolocation feature and the
            corresponding control will be displayed only to the players located in Vienna.
