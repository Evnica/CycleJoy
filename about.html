            CityBike Wien provides around 1500 free city bikes at 121 stations.
            You have to register once with your credit card to make use of the Citybike services. The one-time
            registration fee is € 1.00. The first hour of every ride is always for free, the next hour is € 1.00.
            You can park the bike at one of the 121 stations and use another bike for the next ride.</p>

        <p>

            Once you have chosen one of the challenges you will be forwarded to a map view. First of all you are asked to
            give access to your location. To take part of the quiz-challenge, you have to give permit to access your current
            location.<br>
            <br>
            After you have rent a CityBike at any station in Vienna, the route to first sight, which is the closest point
            from your current location, will be calculated and shown in the map. Once you reach the point the app will give you
            a description about the sight. Some places are museums or restaurants, where you can decide whether you want to
            go in or just discover the sight from the outside.<br>
            <br>
            After you have explored this place and read the description you
            will be forwarded to the quiz by clicking the button. You only have access to this question if you are within
            250 meters of the point.
            <br>
            Is the answer right you will get the new calculated route to the next closest sight.
            <br>
            Did you answer wrong? Then you will get a hint and try to answer the question once again. If you are still wrong,
            the route to a random point will be calculated. It can be that it is not the closest point.<br>
            <br>
            On the way you also have the possibility to activate the editor mode and create your own points of interest or edit already
            existing points to recommend other users places you like.</p>

        <br>


        <p>
        !! The description above is the main idea and functionality  of the application - the current app is a test version !!<br>

        The app is exclusively meant to use in Vienna. Because of test purposes the route to the first sight, independent on your current
        location will be calculated, if you give access to your location. At this sight you can read the description and
        you are able the answer the quiz question, although you are not within the 250 meters distance of the point. In this case
        debug is set to true, so you have the possibility to answer the question and being send to the next point dependent on your answer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            IMPORTANT: If you do no permit access to your current location all sights of the chosen trip are shown in the map and
            the route will not be calculated. You can do the trip without taking part in the quiz challenge!
