        <p>
            All along the tour you will stop in the best places of Vienna. If you reach a sight the app will give you
            a description about the sight. You can decide if you visit the Museum or just discover the sight and
            neighborhood from the outside. Once you have explored this place you have to answer a question. Is the
            answer right you will get the coordinates to find the new location. With the use of an integrated route
            calculator you can insert the new coordinates and calculate the direction to the next sight. On the way
            you also have the possibility to activate the editor mode and create your own points of interest to show
            other users places you like.</p>

        <p>
            After completing the challenge you have the possibility to get a certificate and if you give access your
            name will be stored on the Wall of Fame!</p>
        <p>
            IMPORTANT: If you do not access your location, it is not possible to take part in the quiz challenge! If you do no permit access to your current location all sights of the chosen trip are shown in the map and the route will not be calculated.
